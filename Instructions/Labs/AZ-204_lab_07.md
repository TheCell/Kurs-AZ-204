# Lab 07: Access resource secrets more securely across services

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure user interface (UI) changes after the development of this training content. These changes might cause the lab instructions and lab steps to not match.

Microsoft updates this training course when the community brings needed changes to our attention; however, because cloud updates occur frequently, you might encounter UI changes before this training content updates. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes, and then work through them in the labs as needed.**

#### Task 2: Pull and configure the Azure SDK for .NET

1. On the taskbar, select the **Windows Terminal** icon.
1. Enter the following command, and then select Enter to change the current directory to the **Allfiles (F):\\Allfiles\\Labs\\07\\Starter\\func** empty directory:

    ```powershell
    cd F:\Allfiles\Labs\07\Starter\func
    ```

1. At the open command prompt, enter the following command, and then select Enter to add version **12.6.0** of the **Azure.Storage.Blobs** package from NuGet:

    ```powershell
    dotnet add package Azure.Storage.Blobs --version 12.6.0
    ```

    > **Note**: The [Azure.Storage.Blobs](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Storage.Blobs/12.6.0) NuGet package references the subset of the Azure SDK for .NET required to write code for Azure Blob Storage.
1. Close the currently running **Windows Terminal** application.
1. On the **Start** screen, select the **Visual Studio Code** tile.
1. From the **File** menu, select **Open Folder**.
1. In the **File Explorer** window that opens, browse to **Allfiles (F):\\Allfiles\\Labs\\07\\Starter\\func**, and then select **Select Folder**.
1. In the Explorer pane of the **Visual Studio Code** window, open the **FileParser.cs** file.
1. Add a **using directive** for the **Azure.Storage.Blobs** namespace:

    ```csharp
    using Azure.Storage.Blobs;
    ```

1. Observe the **FileParser.cs** file, which should now include:

    ```csharp
    using Azure.Storage.Blobs;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
    using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
    using System;
    using System.Threading.Tasks;

    public static class FileParser
    {
        [FunctionName("FileParser")]
        public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(
            [HttpTrigger("GET")] HttpRequest request)
        {
            string connectionString = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("StorageConnectionString");
            return new OkObjectResult(connectionString);
        }
    }
    ```

#### Task 3: Write Azure Blob Storage code using the Azure SDK for .NET

1. Within the **Run** method of the **FileParser** class, delete the following line of code:

    ```csharp
    return new OkObjectResult(connectionString);
    ```

1. Still within the **Run** method, add the following code block to create a new instance of the **BlobClient** class by passing in your *connectionString* variable, a  ``"drop"`` string value, and a ``"records.json"`` string value to the constructor:

    ```csharp
    BlobClient blob = new BlobClient(connectionString, "drop", "records.json");
    ```

1. Still within the **Run** method, add the following code block to use the **BlobClient.DownloadAsync** method to download the contents of the referenced blob asynchronously and store the result in a variable named *response*:

    ```csharp
    var response = await blob.DownloadAsync();
    ```

1. Still within the **Run** method, add the following code block to return the value of the various content stored in the *content* variable by using the **FileStreamResult** class constructor:

    ```csharp
    return new FileStreamResult(response?.Value?.Content, response?.Value?.ContentType);
    ```

1. Observe the **FileParser.cs** file again, which should now include:

    ```csharp
    using Azure.Storage.Blobs;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
    using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
    using System;
    using System.Threading.Tasks;

    public static class FileParser
    {
        [FunctionName("FileParser")]
        public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(
            [HttpTrigger("GET")] HttpRequest request)
        {
            string connectionString = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("StorageConnectionString");
            BlobClient blob = new BlobClient(connectionString, "drop", "records.json");
            var response = await blob.DownloadAsync();
            return new FileStreamResult(response?.Value?.Content, response?.Value?.ContentType);
        }
    }
    ```

1. Select **Save** to save your changes to the **FileParser.cs** file.

#### Task 4: Deploy and validate the Azure Functions app

1. On the taskbar, select the **Windows Terminal** icon.
1. Enter the following command, and then select Enter to change the current directory to the **Allfiles (F):\\Allfiles\\Labs\\07\\Starter\\func** empty directory:

    ```powershell
    cd F:\Allfiles\Labs\07\Starter\func
    ```

1. At the open command prompt, enter the following command, and then select Enter to log in to the Azure CLI:

    ```powershell
    az login
    ```

1. In the **Microsoft Edge** browser window, perform the following actions:
    1. Enter the email address for your Microsoft account, and then select **Next**.
    1. Enter the password for your Microsoft account, and then select **Sign in**.
1. Return to the currently open **Windows Terminal** window. Wait for the sign-in process to finish.
1. Enter the following command, and then select Enter to publish the function app project again:

    ```powershell
    func azure functionapp publish <function-app-name>
    ```

    > **Note**: As an example, if your **Function App name** is **securefuncstudent**, your command would be ``func azure functionapp publish securefuncstudent``. You can review the documentation to [publish the local function app project][azure-functions-core-tools-publish-azure] using the **Azure Functions Core Tools**.
1. Wait for the deployment to finalize before you move forward with the lab.
1. Close the currently running **Windows Terminal** application.
1. On the taskbar, select the **Microsoft Edge** icon.
1. In the open browser window, go to the Azure portal (<https://portal.azure.com>).
1. In the Azure portal's navigation pane, select the **Resource groups** link.
1. On the **Resource groups** blade, find and then select the **ConfidentialStack** resource group that you created earlier in this lab.
1. On the **ConfidentialStack** blade, select the **securefunc[yourname]** function app that you created earlier in this lab.
1. From the **App Service** blade, select the **Functions** option from the **Functions** section.
1. In the **Functions** pane, select the the existing **FileParser** function.
1. In the **Function** blade, select the **Code + Test** option from the **Developer** section.
1. In the function editor, select **Test/Run**.
1. In the pop-up dialog box that appears, perform the following actions:
    - In the **HTTP method** list, select **GET**.
1. Select **Run** to test the function.
1. Observe the results of the test run. The output will contain the content of the **$/drop/records.json** blob stored in your Azure Storage account.

> **Review**: In this exercise, you used C\# code to access a storage account, and then downloaded the contents of a blob.

### Exercise 5: Clean up your subscription

#### Task 1: Open Azure Cloud Shell and list resource groups

1. In the Azure portal's navigation pane, select the **Cloud Shell** icon to open a new shell instance.

    > **Note**: The **Cloud Shell** icon is represented by a greater than sign (\>) and underscore character (\_).

1. If this is your first time opening Cloud Shell using your subscription, you can use the **Welcome to Azure Cloud Shell Wizard** to configure Cloud Shell for first-time usage. Perform the following actions in the wizard:

    1. A dialog box prompts you to configure the shell. Select **Bash**, review the selected subscription, and then select **Create storage**.

    > **Note**: Wait for Cloud Shell to finish its initial setup procedures before moving forward with the lab. If Cloud Shell configuration options don't display, this is most likely because you are using an existing subscription with this course's labs. The labs are written with the presumption that you are using a new subscription.

#### Task 2: Delete a resource group

1. When you receive the command prompt, enter the following command, and then select Enter to delete the **ConfidentialStack** resource group:

    ```powershell
    az group delete --name ConfidentialStack --no-wait --yes
    ```

1. Close the Cloud Shell pane in the portal.

#### Task 3: Close the active application

1. Close the currently running Microsoft Edge application.

> **Review**: In this exercise, you cleaned up your subscription by removing the resource groups used in this lab.
